  Comprehensive guides for implementing and using authentication in STING, including Kratos integration, WebAuthn/passkeys, and testing procedures.
---

## Overview

This section contains detailed documentation for STING's authentication system, which uses Ory Kratos for identity management and supports modern authentication methods including passwords, passkeys (WebAuthn), and passwordless authentication.

## Key Topics

- **Kratos Integration** - Understanding and implementing Ory Kratos authentication
- **WebAuthn/Passkeys** - Modern biometric authentication setup and usage
- **Passwordless Authentication** - Email and SMS-based authentication flows
- **Testing** - Comprehensive testing procedures for authentication features

## Authentication Methods

STING supports multiple authentication methods:

1. **Password Authentication** - Traditional email/password login
2. **Passkeys (WebAuthn)** - Biometric and device-based authentication
3. **Passwordless** - Email or SMS one-time codes

## Getting Started

If you're new to STING authentication, start with:

1. [Passwordless Authentication](passwordless-authentication/) - Overview of modern passwordless authentication
2. [Kratos Integration Guide](kratos-integration-guide/) - Understand the authentication architecture
3. [Kratos Login Guide](kratos-login-guide/) - Test basic authentication flows
4. [Passkey Users Guide](passkey-users-guide/) - Set up modern passkey authentication
