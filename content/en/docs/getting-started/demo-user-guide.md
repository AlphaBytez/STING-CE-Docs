# Welcome to STING

You have been granted access to a live STING demo server. This guide will walk you through your first login and some fun things to try.

---

## Logging In

### Step 1: Check Your Email

You should have received a **magic link** email from STING. Click the link to set up your account.

{{% alert title="No email?" color="info" %}}
Check your spam folder. The email comes from the STING server and might get filtered.
{{% /alert %}}

### Step 2: Set Up Your Passkey

After clicking the magic link, you will be prompted to create a **passkey**. This is your secure, passwordless login method.

- **On Mac/Windows:** Your browser will offer to save the passkey to your device or password manager (1Password, iCloud Keychain, etc.)
- **On Mobile:** You can use Face ID, Touch ID, or your device PIN

{{% alert title="Tip" color="success" %}}
Passkeys are phishing-resistant and more secure than passwords. No more remembering complex strings!
{{% /alert %}}

### Step 3: You're In!

Once your passkey is set up, you will land on the STING dashboard.
