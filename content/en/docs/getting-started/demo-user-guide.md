# Welcome to STING! 🐝

You've been granted access to a live STING demo server. This guide will walk you through your first login and some fun things to try.

## Logging In

### Step 1: Check Your Email

You should have received a **magic link** email from STING. Click the link to set up your account.

> **No email?** Check your spam folder. The email comes from the STING server and might get filtered.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Passkey

After clicking the magic link, you'll be prompted to create a **passkey**. This is your secure, passwordless login method.

- On **Mac/Windows**: Your browser will offer to save the passkey to your device or password manager (1Password, iCloud Keychain, etc.)
- On **Mobile**: You can use Face ID, Touch ID, or your device PIN

> **Tip:** Passkeys are phishing-resistant and more secure than passwords. No more remembering complex strings!

### Step 3: You're In!

Once your passkey is set up, you'll land on the STING dashboard. Welcome to the hive! 🍯
