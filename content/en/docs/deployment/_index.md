# Deployment Guide

Deploy STING to production environments with confidence.

## Deployment Options

### Docker Compose (Recommended)
Standard deployment using Docker Compose for single-server setups.

### Kubernetes (Enterprise)
Scalable deployment for large organizations.

### Manual Deployment
Deploy individual components without Docker.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] System requirements verified
- [ ] Domain configured
- [ ] SSL certificates ready
- [ ] Database backups enabled
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] Secrets management configured
- [ ] Monitoring setup complete

## Clean Installation

Step-by-step guide for fresh STING installations:

1. Prepare environment
2. Configure domain
3. Set up SSL/TLS
4. Deploy containers
5. Initialize database
6. Create admin user
7. Verify installation

## Post-Installation

Tasks to complete after deployment:

- Verify all services are healthy
- Test authentication flows
- Configure backups
- Set up monitoring
- Configure alerts
- Document deployment.

## Production Configuration

### Security Hardening
- HTTPS enforcement
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Firewall rules
- Secret rotation.

### Performance Tuning
- Database indexing
- Cache configuration
- Resource limits
- Connection pooling.

### Monitoring
- Health checks
- Log aggregation
- Metrics collection
- Alerting rules.

## Backup & Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Database backups (daily)
- Vault backups (hourly)
- Configuration backups
- File storage backups.

### Recovery Procedures
- Point-in-time recovery
- Disaster recovery plan
- Rollback procedures.

## Updates & Maintenance

### Update Process
1. Review changelog
2. Backup current state
3. Test in staging
4. Deploy to production
5. Verify functionality
6. Monitor for issues

### Maintenance Windows
Schedule regular maintenance for:
- Security updates
- Feature updates
- Database optimization
- Certificate renewal.

## Scaling

### Vertical Scaling
Increase resources for existing servers.

### Horizontal Scaling
Add more application servers behind a load balancer.

## Platform-Specific Guides

- macOS deployment
- Ubuntu/Linux deployment
- WSL2 deployment
- Cloud provider guides (AWS, Azure, GCP)

## Troubleshooting Deployment

- Installation failures
- Service startup issues
- Network connectivity
- Permission problems.

## Deployment Best Practices

- Use version control for configurations
- Document all customizations
- Implement CI/CD pipelines
- Regular security audits
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor resource usage.
