# Password Change Flow Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a proper password change flow that allows users with `force_password_change=true` to login with limited access solely to change their password.

## Problem
Users with the `force_password_change` flag set (like the default admin) were caught in a catch-22:
- They couldn't login because password change was required
- They couldn't change their password without being logged in

## Solution

### 1. Special Login Component (`PasswordChangeLogin.jsx`)
A dedicated login page at `/password-change-login` that:
- Accepts email and current password
- Validates credentials
- Creates a limited session for password change only
- Enforces strong password requirements
- Provides visual feedback on password strength

### 2. Backend Endpoint (`/api/auth/password-change-login`)
Special endpoint that:
- Verifies user credentials with Kratos
- Checks if user has `force_password_change=true`
- Creates a limited session with `password_change_required=true`
- Only allows access to password change endpoints

### 3. Middleware Updates
The `force_password_change.py` middleware now allows:
- Access to `password_change_login` endpoint
- Limited session access for password changes
- Blocks all other endpoints until password is changed

### 4. Authentication Flow Updates
The `UnifiedAuthProvider` now:
- Detects `PASSWORD_CHANGE_REQUIRED` errors
- Automatically redirects to `/password-change-login`
- Prevents authentication loops

## Usage

### For Default Admin
1. Navigate to `https://localhost:8443/password-change-login`
2. Enter:
   - Email: `admin@sting.local`
   - Password: (from `~/.sting-ce/admin_password.txt`)
3. Set a new strong password
4. System automatically logs you in after password change

### For New Users
When creating users with temporary passwords:
1. Set `force_password_change: true` in user traits
2. Provide them the password change login URL
3. They must change password on first login

## Security Features
- Strong password requirements (12+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special)
- Real-time password strength indicator
- Limited session scope (only password change allowed)
- Automatic session upgrade after password change
- Secure password verification through Kratos

## Alternative Solutions

### Quick Fixes (Not Recommended for Production)
1. **Clear Force Password Flag**: `python scripts/clear-force-password-change.py`
2. **Create New Admin**: `python scripts/create-new-admin.py`
3. **Reset Password**: `python scripts/reset_admin_password.py`

These bypass security and should only be used in development or emergency situations.
