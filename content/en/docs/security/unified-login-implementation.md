# Unified Login Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a unified login flow that checks if a user exists before presenting authentication options, as requested.

## Changes Made

### Frontend
1. **Created UnifiedLogin Component** (`frontend/src/components/auth/UnifiedLogin.jsx`)
   - Email-first approach where users enter their email address
   - Checks if user exists via `/api/auth/check-user` endpoint
   - Presents appropriate authentication methods based on user configuration
   - Shows registration prompt if user doesn't exist
   - Supports multiple authentication methods (password, passkey, etc.)

2. **Updated Routes** (`frontend/src/auth/AuthenticationWrapper.jsx`)
   - Changed `/login` route to use UnifiedLogin component instead of Login component
   - Maintains backward compatibility with other auth routes

### Backend
3. **Added Check User Endpoint** (`app/routes/auth_routes.py`)
   - New endpoint: `POST /api/auth/check-user`
   - Accepts email address in request body
   - Returns whether user exists and available authentication methods
   - Currently checks local User database and PasskeyCredential table

## API Endpoint Details

### POST /api/auth/check-user
**Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

**Response (user exists):**
```json
{
  "exists": true,
  "authMethods": ["password", "passkey"]
}
```

**Response (user doesn't exist):**
```json
{
  "exists": false,
  "authMethods": []
}
```

## User Flow

1. User visits `/login`
2. User enters email address
3. System checks if user exists
4. If user exists:
   - With passkey only: Directly initiates passkey authentication
   - With multiple methods: Shows method selection screen
   - With password only: Shows password entry screen
5. If user doesn't exist:
   - Shows friendly message with option to create account
   - Provides link to registration page

## Testing

Use the test script to verify the implementation:
```bash
./scripts/troubleshooting/test_unified_login.sh
```

Or manually test:
1. Visit https://localhost:8443/login
2. Try with existing and non-existing email addresses
3. Verify appropriate flows are presented
