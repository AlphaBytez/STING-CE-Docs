# STING Architecture

Technical documentation of STING's architecture, design patterns, and system components.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Overview
STING is built as a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Frontend**: React-based SPA.
- **Backend**: Python Flask API.
- **Chatbot**: AI/LLM service.
- **Messaging**: Real-time communication service.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching.
- **Authentication**: Ory Kratos identity management.
- **Vault**: HashiCorp Vault for secrets management.

### Component Architecture

#### Frontend Architecture
- React 18+ with hooks.
- Material-UI component library.
- Glass theme system.
- Responsive design.
- Progressive Web App (PWA) ready.

#### Backend Architecture
- Flask REST API.
- SQLAlchemy ORM.
- Celery task queue.
- Redis caching layer.
- WebSocket support.

#### AI/ML Architecture
- Ollama integration.
- Local LLM support.
- Vector database (ChromaDB).
- Embedding generation.
- Semantic search.

## Data Architecture

### Database Schema
- User management.
- Honey Jar storage.
- PII detection records.
- Audit logs.
- Session management.

### Data Flow
Request → Authentication → Authorization → Processing → Response

### Caching Strategy
Multi-layer caching with Redis for performance optimization.

## API Architecture

RESTful API design with:
- Versioning.
- Rate limiting.
- Authentication middleware.
- Error handling.
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth
Multiple security layers:
- Network security.
- Application security.
- Data encryption.
- Access controls.
- Audit logging.

### Authentication Architecture
- Passwordless-first.
- Multi-factor authentication.
- Session management.
- Token-based API access.

## Deployment Architecture

### Docker Deployment
Multi-container setup with Docker Compose:
- Application containers.
- Database containers.
- Cache containers.
- Reverse proxy.

### Service Health Monitoring
Health checks and readiness probes for all services.

### Service Startup Resilience
Graceful degradation and retry logic.

## Scalability

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless application servers.
- Database read replicas.
- Load balancing.
- Session affinity.

### Vertical Scaling
- Resource optimization.
- Caching strategies.
- Database indexing.
- Query optimization.
