# STING Chatbot Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Implementation - Initial Standalone Approach

### Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Created the basic `chat_service.py` implementation in the `llm_service/chat` directory:
   - Implemented conversation management
   - Added GatewayLLM class to connect to existing LLM infrastructure
   - Implemented basic tool support framework.

2. ✅ Created a dedicated chatbot service with FastAPI:
   - Created new `chatbot` directory with standalone implementation
   - Implemented `/chat/message` endpoint for message processing
   - Added `/chat/history` endpoint for retrieving conversation history
   - Added `/chat/clear` endpoint for clearing conversations
   - Implemented a health check endpoint.

3. ✅ Added chatbot configuration to config files:
   - Updated both `config.yml` and `config.yml.default` with chatbot section
   - Implemented environment-based configuration fallback.

4. ✅ Created enhanced frontend chat components:
   - Implemented `/frontend/src/components/chat/enhanced/EnhancedChat.jsx`
   - Added support for tools, errors, and loading states
   - Created demo page at `/chat-demo` route.

5. ✅ Prepared deployment infrastructure:
   - Created Dockerfile for the chatbot service
   - Created docker-compose.yaml for easy deployment
   - Added startup scripts.

### Current Architecture

The chatbot service is designed as a standalone microservice that:

1. Integrates with the existing LLM Gateway service for model access
2. Provides an API for conversation management and tool integration
3. Can be deployed independently or alongside other STING services
4. Supports configuration via environment variables or config.yml
5. Connects to the frontend through the enhanced chat components

This approach offers the following advantages:
- No dependency on the config_loader for easier deployment
- Easily scalable as a separate service
- Minimal changes to existing services
- Direct control over the chatbot implementation.

### Next Steps

#### Phase 1 (Remaining)

1. Test implementation:
   - Run the standalone chatbot service using `./start-chatbot.sh`
   - Test API endpoints through direct API calls
   - Test frontend chat integration at `/chat-demo`
   - Validate conversation persistence.

2. Implement robust tool examples:
   - Complete the search documents tool implementation
   - Add document summarization capabilities
   - Implement analytics or reporting tools.

3. Enhance error handling and validation:
   - Add input validation for API endpoints
   - Improve error messages and recovery
   - Implement rate limiting for API protection.

#### Phase 2: Admin Configurability

1. Create admin interface for chatbot configuration:
   - Design UI for managing chatbot settings
   - Implement configuration editor
   - Add tool management capabilities.

2. Extend configuration options:
   - Add model selection preferences
   - Enable custom system prompts
   - Implement conversational profiles.

3. Implement user management for conversations:
   - Add conversation export capabilities
   - Implement conversation analysis tools
   - Add conversation search functionality.

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Frontend

1. Improve chat UI:
   - Add message typing indicators
   - Implement markdown support
   - Add file upload capabilities.

2. Integrate with authentication:
   - Tie conversations to authenticated users
   - Implement role-based tool access
   - Add conversation privacy controls.

3. Add more advanced features:
   - Implement conversation branching
   - Add command suggestions
   - Support multimedia responses.

## Testing Instructions

To test the current implementation:

1. Start the chatbot service and required LLM services:
   ```bash
   ./start-chatbot.sh
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server if it's not already running:
   ```bash
   ./restart-frontend.sh
   ```

3. Navigate to the chat in the dashboard:
   ```
   http://localhost:8443/dashboard/chat
   ```

4. Alternatively, use the API directly:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/chat/message \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"user_id": "test-user", "message": "Hello, Bee!"}'
   ```

### Service Status Indicators

The chat interface now includes service status indicators that show the availability of both the chatbot and LLM Gateway services. These indicators help with development and debugging:

- 🟢 Green: Service is available and responding
- 🟠 Amber: Service is unavailable or not responding
- ⏳ Gray: Service status is being checked

### Fallback Mechanism

The system implements a three-tier fallback mechanism:

1. First tries to use the chatbot service for full conversational capabilities
2. Falls back to direct LLM gateway access if chatbot is unavailable
3. Provides mock responses when both services are unavailable

This ensures the UI remains functional during development and testing, even when backend services are not fully operational.

### Development Mode

When both services are unavailable, the chat operates in "development mode" with the following characteristics:

- Mock responses are provided for user messages
- All messages are clearly labeled as development mode responses
- Special styling indicates non-production status.

This allows frontend development to proceed even without the backend services running.

## Implementation Notes

- The chatbot service can be deployed separately from the main STING application
- Configuration can be managed through environment variables or the config.yml file
- Conversation context is maintained in memory for now, but could be moved to a database in the future
- The frontend component uses session storage to maintain a consistent user ID across page refreshes.

## Recent Improvements

- **Enhanced Chat Interface**: Added service status indicators, improved fallback mechanisms, and development mode.
- **Resilient UI Design**: The chat interface now works even when backend services are unavailable.
- **Better Service Integration**: Improved proxy configuration and error handling for API routes.
- **Streamlined Testing**: Updated startup script with service health checks and troubleshooting tips.
- **Focused Integration**: Consolidated on dashboard chat interface instead of separate demo page.
- **Dashboard Integration**: Chat is now fully integrated into the main dashboard with consistent styling.

## Known Issues / Limitations

- In-memory conversation storage will not persist across service restarts
- Tool implementations are currently placeholders and need real functionality
- The system doesn't have built-in rate limiting or quota management yet
- The frontend doesn't show conversation history on initial load
- LLM models may fail to load if directory paths are missing or incorrectly configured
- Model loading can take significant time on first startup
